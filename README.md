emailSpam
=========

An email spam bot written in Python, to send emails to specified addresses. Use with caution.

Simply make sure you have Python 2+ installed, with smtp support. Edit the password.txt file, recipients, and
your email username to start zipping out those emails!

CAUTION: Use at your own risk. No one is responsible but you for misuse of this code to tick people off. Cheers!

(Note: depending on your email client, you may be initially blocked because of security reasons. Simply disable
this setting for now, and then the program will run fine.
